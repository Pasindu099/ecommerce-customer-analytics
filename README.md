# 🛍️ E-commerce Customer Behavior & Sales Analysis

This project analyzes customer transactions from a UK-based online retail store to identify purchasing patterns, segment customers, and predict customer value using machine learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw transaction data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover behavioral trends
- Segment customers using RFM analysis and business rules
- Engineer advanced features such as Average Order Value and Customer Type
- Build a regression model to predict customer revenue
- Deliver business insights and strategic recommendations

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Random Forest
- **Customer Segmentation**: RFM Scoring
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **RFM Segmentation**: Customers scored based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value
- **Behavioral Clustering**: Segments labeled as VIP, Loyal, Potential, At Risk
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting customer revenue using regression techniques
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes AOV, OrderCount, and CustomerType

## 🧠 Insights & Recommendations

- VIP customers, though few, contribute the majority of total revenue.
- Regular customers have lower engagement and are potential candidates for conversion strategies.
- Predictive modeling helps prioritize marketing spend toward high-value customers.
- Actionable strategies include retention campaigns for VIPs, re-engagement for At Risk, and conversion funnels for Potentials.
